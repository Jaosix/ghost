Banshee
- Hunts based off the target’s sanity: 50% sanity
- Targets only one player as long as they’re alive and inside the house
- If the target leaves the house, the banshee will hunt normally
- When the target dies, the banshee will select a new target
- Will ignore all non-targets during a hunt
- Increased chance for singing ghost events
- Has a unique parabolic microphone sound: sounds like a scream
- Will follow target around
Demon
- Very aggressive ghost hunt wise
- Can hunt at 70% naturally with a rare chance to hunt at any sanity
- Minimum cooldown between hunts is 20 seconds (other ghosts is 25 seconds)
- Smudging a demon will prevent it from hunting for 60 seconds (compared to 90 seconds for most ghosts and 180 seconds for spirit)
- Crucifix will prevent a hunt for a demon with an increased range of 5m (instead of 3m for other ghosts)
Deogen
- You’re unable to hide from this ghost
- To tell if its a deo while hiding, listen to its speed: if its super fast and then slows down when it gets closer to your hiding spot, try and leave your hiding spot and move somewhere that you can loop the ghost
- Deos are VERY slow when they are near you so they are super easy to loop
- Has a unique spirit box response that sounds like a growl or heavy breathing
- Increased chanced of writing and dots
- Will always have spirit box on nightmare
Goryo
- Goryo dots can only be seen through the video camera
- Will also not show dots if you’re in the same room as it
- To check for a goryo, make sure no players are in its room and look for dots through the video camera
- Dots is forced evidence on Nightmare mode
- If you see dots without the use of a video camera, you can rule out goryo
- Will not leave its room as often as other ghosts and will not change its favorite room
Hantu
- Lower the temps, the quicker a hantu will be

    15C+ = 1.4m/s
    12C = 1.75
    9C = 2.1
    6C = 2.3
    3C = 2.5
    0C (freezing) = 2.7

- Does not gradually speed up with line of sight
- Has an increased chance to turn off the breaker
- Will produce freezing breath during a hunt in any room if the breaker is off
- Will always have freezing temps on Nightmare mode
Jinn
- When the breaker is on and the Jinn get’s line of site with a player, it will get faster (not as fast as a revenant and not as slow as a Revenant without LOS)
- When it gets within 3m of a player, it will slow down to normal ghost speed
- Has the ability to zap 25% sanity when near a player and the breaker is on: will give an emf reading at the breaker when this ability is performed
- Unable to turn off the breaker (if the Jinn happens to turn on a light which causes the breaker to trip, it could still be a Jinn)
Tip: Turn off the breaker to disable all abilities
Mare
- Can hunt at 60% sanity when the lights are off, 40% sanity when the lights are on
- Unable to turn on a light
- Higher chance of performing a light breaking event
- Wanders more if lights are on in its room
- Has a chance of immediately switching a light off that has been turned on
- Mare test consists of turning on a light in its room and seeing if it immediately turns it off
Tip: Don’t spam the light on and off, this won’t work
Mimic
- The only ghost to have 4 pieces of evidence on professional difficulty and below (Orbs being the piece of evidence you will get that is not listed in the journal for Mimic)
- Will always have Orbs on Nightmare Mode
- Will also always have orbs if you’re playing with no evidence
- Will change the ghost it mimics every 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Easiest way to see if its a mimic is to see if there are orbs in addition to its 3 pieces of evidence (2 evidence on nightmare)
- If I have orbs as evidence, I ALWAYS check for the mimics other evidence (fingerprints, spirit box, freezing) to ensure its not a mimic
- Cannot change its behavior mid hunt
- So if you notice a ghost changes its behavior every couple hunts, check for mimic
Moroi
- Speed demon
- Curses a player when they get a response on either the spirit box or the parabolic mic
- Curse causes the players sanity to drain twice as fast, with lights and candles unable to prevent this curse
- To remove the curse, take sanity pills
- Smudging during a hunt will blind the moroi for 12 seconds, instead of 6 seconds for other ghosts
- The lower your sanity, the faster the moroi
- To test for a moroi, get a spirit box response and either stay in the light or hold a candle, if your sanity continues to drain, it’s likely a moroi
- If you’re playing with no evidence, see if the ghost gets faster the more your sanity drains
- Moroi will also get line of site speed, so at 0% sanity and enough LOS speed, Moroi becomes the fastest ghost in the game
- Spirit box is forced evidence on nightmare
Myling
- Little sneaky ninja assassin
- Can only be heard during a hunt at a range of 12 meters or less (which includes footsteps AND vocal hunt noises)
- All other ghosts can be heard up to 20 meters away
- Myling will also respond more on the parabolic microphone
- To test for a myling, hide with your flashlight or put dots on the floor, if you only hear footsteps during a hunt right when your equipment starts flickering, its likely a Myling
Obake
- The only ghost that can leave a 6 fingered fingerprint
- Fingerprints are forced evidence on Nightmare
- Has a 25% to not leave fingerprints
- Also able to cut the duration of fingerprints in half if it uses its ability
- During a hunt, the Obake has a chance to shapeshift
- It will briefly flash as another ghost model of the same gender
- It was a 6.66% chance every time it blinks during a hunt to shapeshift
- To test for an obake during a hunt, loop it for as long as possible and see if it changes ghost models
- I’ve also seen it change the stance of a ghost model during a hunt (i.e. when from being the standing child to the crawling child in one hunt)
- Can also have it run at you from a long corridor and see if the blink changes
Oni
- Unable to do the “ghost mist” or “air ball” ghost event
- Much more visible during a hunt, meaning it blinks a lot less than other ghosts
- Has a higher chance of showing its full form during ghost events (instead of being a shadow or transparent)
- Will drain double the sanity when a ghost event hits you
Onryo
- Unable to hunt within 4m of a flame
- If it blows out 3 flames and there are no other flames nearby to prevent it from hunting, it will trigger a hunt at any sanity
- To test for an onryo, put candles and crucifixes in its room
- If the ghost uses a crucifix without blowing out the candle, rule out onryo
- If it only uses a crucifix after blowing out all the candles with a 4m range, it’s likely an onryo
- May also wander away from the candles and initiate a hunt
Phantom
- Has a much longer blink during hunts, making it seem almost invisible
- Will immediately disappear when you take a picture during a ghost event and you will continue to hear the ghost event audio
- Will not appear in the picture when you take a ghost picture
- Also able to wander to a targeted player (not to be mistaken with the Wraith teleport)
Poltergeist
- More likely to throw items, decreases player sanity by 2% for every item thrown
- During hunts, it has a 100% chance to thrown an object nearby every .5 seconds compared to 50% for other ghosts
- Can do an “explosion” of items
Tip: Create a pile of items in the ghost room, and it will explode the items
Raiju
- Faster around electronics that are turned on: 50% speed without electronics, 65% speed with electronics
- Must be within 6m of equipment on small maps, 8m on medium maps, and 10m on large maps
- Headcams are the only equipment that does not effect a Raiju
- When hunting, electronics will malfunction at 15m for a Raji as opposed to 10m for other ghosts
- May be easy to confuse a Raiju with a Myling because of the above fact, so make sure to pay attention to its speed near powered electronics
Revenant
- Will be very slow when player location is unknown (1m/s)
- When it sees a player, it will immediately speed up to 3m/s
- After reaching the players last known location, it will gradually slow back down if it doesn’t see the player
- Best tell for a revenant: slow steps when it does not see a player, and instantly fast speeds when it does see a player
Shade
- Very shy and boring ghost
- Will often show up in shadow form during ghost events or do more airball ghost events
- Ghost event chance increases the lower the average sanity
- Will not throw objects if you are in the same room as it
- Will not hunt if there is a player nearby
- To test for a shade, sit in the ghost room with a crucifix, if your sanity is low enough for the ghost to hunt and it’s not hunting or using a crucifix, probably a shade
Spirit
- When you smudge a spirit, it prevents it from hunting for 180 seconds (3 minutes) instead of the usual 90 seconds for most ghosts, 60 seconds for Demon
Thaye
- The only ghost capable of aging
- Will start out young at the beginning of the game, making it more active and more aggressive and can hunt at 75% sanity and be super fast 2.5m/s
- Every 1-2 minutes that you’re near a Thaye, it has a chance of aging
- At it’s oldest, it lowers the hunting threshold to 15% and speed 1m/s
- Does not have line of site speed increase, so it will not speed up gradually while chasing you
- To test for a thaye, pay attention to its speed during hunts if you’ve been hanging out in its ghost room enough to age it
- If it seems to slow down each hunt, its likely a Thaye
- It will also tell you a different age on the ouija board if you ask it its age at the beginning of the game and then again later on once you’ve aged it
Twins
- Able to interact with multiple objects at the same time in different rooms
- Over the course of multiple hunts, you may hear different speeds
- Twins has the chance during a hunt to send out either a slightly faster ghost (110%) or a slightly slower ghost (90%)
- Will only send out one ghost during a hunt
- May also hunt from a different location from the ghost room if it’s sending out its “decoy” twin
Wraith
- Wraith will never step in a salt pile or leave UV footsteps
- They can teleport to a player outside of a hunt which will give a EMF 2 reading
Yokai
- Has a chance to hunt at 80% when players nearby are talking (otherwise hunts at 50% sanity)
- During a hunt, unable to detect your voice or equipment further than 2.5m away
- You can get much loser to a yokai with a music box before the box will break
- Ghost activity is increased when talking near a Yokai
- To test for a yokai, hide in a room nearby with equipment on and yell at it during a hunt: if you’re close enough and the ghost doesn’t find you, probably a yokai
Yurei
- Has the ability to zap 15% sanity if a player is nearby
- When it uses it ability, it will also fully close a door in its room
- When smudged, the yurei will be trapped in its room for a period of time
